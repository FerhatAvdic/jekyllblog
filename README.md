# How to manage content on your site

This site is made using Jekyll, a static site generator, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.

The content is editable through Markdown files (files with .md extension).

>A MARKDOWN file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. It uses plain text formatting but contains inline text symbols that specify how to format the text (e.g., *bold* for bold text, or other markups for italics, indentation, headers, etc.).
